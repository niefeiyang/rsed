|-> rsed/cmdb

#### Usage Instructions:
Activate the cmdb venv environment by using `source bin/activate` in the cmdb directory.
Modify the `query_texts` and `folder_path` in `main.py` under the `cmdb/code` directory to test search parameters. `cmdb/lektor` and `cmdb/st` are two git repositories used for testing, where the former is written in Python and the latter is written in C.
